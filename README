Python program PSR_LowMassComp_ECCvsPb_plot_maker.py will create a plot like Eccen_vs_OrbitalPeriod.pdf. 
Reading binary system information from textfiles PSR_Period_Pb_ECC_MinMassWithErrors_finalList.txt and NEW_PSR.txt.

The plot is eccentricity ( e ) as a a function of orbital period ( P b ) for recycled pulsars with low-mass
companion ( < 0.4M ). The dashed line represents the prediction expected from the evolutionary scenario
by Phinney (1992)[ref: Phinney E. S., 1992, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society
of London Series A, 341,39 ]. Most recycled pulsars follow this line (shown as solid black circles), although eccentric
( e ∼ 0.027 − 0.14 , shown as in blue stars) binaries are found (Knispel et al., 2015; Camilo et al., 2015;
Barr et al., 2017a; Octau et al., 2018; Stovall et al., 2019) that likely result from a different evolutionary
process (Antoniadis, 2014). For some time, these systems were the only ones found in the P b ∼ 22 − 32
days region. The newly discovered PSRs J0732 + 2314 and J0824 + 0028 (shown as solid red triangles) are
in that P b region, but are low eccentricity. Also PSR J0509 + 0856 follows Phinney (1992) evolutionary
prediction very well.
